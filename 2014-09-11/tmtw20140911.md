#Criticisms

- iPhone **accessory**
- Price
- Battery Life?
> "..as more details emerge, it's becoming clear that the device's battery won't last much longer than one day." --[Mashable][BatteryLife]
- Smartwatches: Niche / Mainstream?
- What if you're a lefty?
- Where is the Killer App?

# [fit] New UX Paradigms

---

## Apple Watch
- Tiny screen
- Tap vs. Press
- Crown
- Keyboard alternatives (i.e. Voice / Quick responses)
- "Onboard" sensors (accelerometer, pulse)
- iPhone sensors (GPS &  wifi) via 802.11b/g and Bluetooth 4.0

## iPhone6 Plus
- "One-handed" controls

---

# [fit] Apple Pay

---

## Initial thoughts
- Begins in US, October 2014 (MasterCard, Visa, Amex)
- A bit like PayPass, using your iPhone (or Apple Watch)
- Described as being more secure than a credit card
- App integration

## How big is this?
- End to paper money?
- How much longer do I need to carry a physical wallet for?
- How does this affect the cross-platform economy?

# [fit] U2 Album Launch

---

- 13th album: Songs of Innocence
- Universal and U2 were paid an undisclosed lump sum, for the exclusive window to distribute the album  [Wall Street Journal][http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/09/09/u2-apple-and-the-deal-behind-getting-songs-of-innocence-free-of-charge/]
> "We were paid" ... "I don’t believe in free music. Music is a sacrament." --[Bono, via Time.com][http://time.com/3313164/bono-u2-apple-itunes/]

# [fit] Macworld
> "After 30 years, MacWorld is no longer a Magazine" --[FastCompany][FastCompany]

---

> " To their great credit, they allowed us to end our relationship amicably. I thank them for their support and their generosity. They even asked me to write a final front-of-the-book column in the November issue of Macworld.
> Unfortunately, many of my colleagues lost their jobs today. If there's anything I can do to help them, I will. I have had time to plan for this day, but they haven't. You probably know some of them. Please join with me in giving them sympathy and support." --[Jason Snell][SnellWorld]

> "Re-reading Snell’s announcement, I have to say, it’s a masterpiece of tone and restraint." --[John Gruber][DaringFirball]
