#Our most personal device yet.

> Our goal has always been to make powerful technology more accessible. More relevant. And ultimately more personal. Apple Watch represents a new chapter in the relationship people have with technology. It’s the most personal product we’ve ever made, because it’s the first one designed to be worn.

> "..as more details emerge, it's becoming clear that the device's battery won't last much longer than one day." --[Mashable][BatteryLife]
- Smartwatches: Niche / Mainstream?
- What if you're a lefty?
- Where is the Killer App?

![right](http://images.apple.com/watch/features/images/face_maps_large.png)

---

![right](http://images.apple.com/v/watch/a/technology/images/sensor_large.jpg)
## UX: Apple Watch
- Tiny screen
- Tap vs. Press
- Crown
- Keyboard alternatives (i.e. Voice / Quick responses)
- "Onboard" sensors (accelerometer, pulse detection)
- iPhone sensors (GPS &  wifi) via 802.11b/g and Bluetooth 4.0

---

## UX: iPhone6 Plus
- "One-handed" controls
- Expanded keyboard (copy/paste...etc)

# [fit] Apple Pay

---

## Apple Pay: Initial thoughts
- A bit like PayPass, using your iPhone (or Apple Watch)
- Begins in US, October 2014 (MasterCard, Visa, Amex)
- Pin / fingerprint
- Described as being "more secure" than a credit card... or not:
 - [http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/09/how-safe-can-apple-pay-really-be/]
- App integration

---

## Apple Pay: How big is this?
- End to paper money?
- How much longer do I need to carry a physical wallet for?
- How does this affect the cross-platform economy?

# [fit] U2 Album Launch

---

- 13th album: **Songs of Innocence**
- **Free to download** (next 5 weeks)
- Universal and U2 were paid

# [fit] Macworld
> "After 30 years, Macworld is no longer a Magazine" --[FastCompany][FastCompany]

---

### Jason Snell:
> " To their great credit, they allowed us to end our relationship amicably. I thank them for their support and their generosity. They even asked me to write a final front-of-the-book column in the November issue of Macworld.
> Unfortunately, many of my colleagues lost their jobs today. If there's anything I can do to help them, I will. I have had time to plan for this day, but they haven't. You probably know some of them. Please join with me in giving them sympathy and support." --[Jason Snell][SnellWorld]

---

### John Gruber:
> "Re-reading Snell's announcement, I have to say, it's a masterpiece of tone and restraint." --[John Gruber][DaringFirball]
